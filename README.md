# Summer Internship 2025 - M1
During my summer internship in 2025, I made a project for a pharmaceutical products’ distribution company in Brazil. For this project, I had to create a dashboard to show the products that might expire without being sold, causing wastes to the company. For reasons of confidentiality, I can’t show the dashboard on this website.
This project a quite simple by the technical point of view, I had only one database, but it was important to acquire experience on data analysis.

## Data treatment
On a weekly basis, I received a database containing expected losses for products that had been purchased in excess. These datasets were used to continuously update the analytical model.
Data preparation and transformation were performed using Excel and DAX. I reshaped the data and created new KPIs derived from existing indicators to better assess expiration risk and potential financial losses.

## KPIs
Together with my internship tutor, we chose the KPIs thinking about how the company could find solutions for these products before the expiration date and gain perspectives on new purchases.

Through a search using the product code, we could see the lots corresponding to this product, its description, its supplier, the quantity, and the potential losses in the lot.

We also could see the main suppliers and the main active ingredients causing the most losses.
